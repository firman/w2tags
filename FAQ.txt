=== I have Patern in HOT with define close and autoclosing (!/) at first line. How do I use it, since patern write after define close.

If you have "ul_li" patern ( below ), it can't be use since define closing ( <</ ) 
immediately push to stack after "ul_li" patern called, and then perser will loop inside 
"ul_li" patern line by line, it counter the first line to popup all the stack where 
indentation is the same or wider, and it means current patern have same indentations.

  >>ul_li
  !/
  <div>
    %ul
      ^$*
  <</
  </div>
  
to get work-around of this situations, you define two patern like this:

  >>ul_li
  !/
  <div>
    %ul
      ^$*
  %end_div

  >>end_div
  <</
  </div>

the last line in "ul_li" patern, will call %end_div and it will push define closing 
to stack "end".

In README.txt if patern change to have auto closing ( !/ ), the change are:

  >>if
  !/
  - if $*
  %end_if
  
  >>end_if
  <</
  - end

=== Why you not implement > and < (Remove White Spaces) 
  
Work-around to make tag near each other by put command tag inline, lets see the example
(borrow from pastie in HAML mailling list)

HAML style
  
  %ul.tabSet
    %li.tabs.off<
      %a Overview
    %li.tabs.off<
      %a 200 calories
    %li.tabs.off<
      %a 100 grams
    - for tab in @tabs
      %li.tabs.off<
        %a= tab
  .panelSet

W2TAGS style

  %ul.tabSet
    %li.tabs.off %a!Overview
    %li.tabs.off %a!200 calories
    %li.tabs.off %a!100 grams
    -for tab in @tabs
      %li.tabs.off %a=!tab
  .panelSet

Or you can put repetitif patern to HOT file "list.hot"

  >>lia
  %li.tabs.off %a!$0
  
And Refactor to become

  !hot!list
  %ul.tabSet
    %lia Overview;200 calories;100 grams
    -for tab in @tabs
      %lia tab
  .panelSet
